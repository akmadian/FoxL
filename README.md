# FoxL

### FoxL is about a fox. The game is a work in progress and has no real direction at the moment other than the aim to create a beautiful world and a fun game.

If you download FoxL with the intention of editing, you must open the GameScene in Assets/Scenes folder.

The purpose of FoxL is to help me learn C# and how to manage more complex project structures.

The L in FoxL stands for Low Poly.
